                <h1>Remembering Steve</h1>
                <p>Over a million people from all over the world have shared their memories, thoughts, and feelings
                    about Steve. One thing they all have in common — from personal friends to colleagues to owners of
                    Apple products — is how they’ve been touched by his passion and creativity. You can view some of
                    these messages below.<br>

                    <p class="tribute-text">Steve Jobs: You helped me with my career choice. You helped me organise my
                        life. You helped me beat the boredom of hours on the road. You helped me access knowledge. You
                        helped me stay connected with friends and family. You helped me share my life with those who
                        matter. Thank you, Steve, you are an inspiration. Rest in peace. </p>

                    <h1 class="tribute-heading">What Steve did for me</h1>
                    <p class="tribute-text">I was a total PC fan, and never understood Apple fans. Reading a bit about
                        what Steve was doing to Apple two years ago, I thought to myself "There must be something I am
                        missing, and as a teacher I need to understand why some people are so fond of these machines".
                        And it started with an offer for an iMac. The seller told me "Once you start with this, there is
                        no return. You will not want to go back to a PC". How right he was! I am now mainly using Apple,
                        only turning to a PC notebook due to me teaching in that environment. Sad to have missed so many
                        years of what Steve had been producing together with all you Apple people. He will certainly be
                        missed, but definitly not forgotten. His legacy is with you people. Make him proud. WIth my
                        deepest sympathy to all the Jobs family and the Apple family</p>

                    <p class="tribute-text">Thank you Steve, you sure left a remarkable mark on the world. I am a
                        computer science student and you are my inspiring hero. I learned a lot with you. Thank you
                        Steve !</p>

                    <p class="tribute-text">My deepest condolences to Steve's family and everyone at Apple. I met Steve
                        in 1978, a young kid in blue jeans, a white tee-shirt, and sneakers. If anyone deserved a Nobel
                        Prize, it was Steve. His creative spirit, uncompromising demand for quality, and his sense of
                        aesthetics will be sorely missed.</p>

                    <p class="tribute-text">Many want to change the world, and we all do to varying extents. Some for
                        the better, some for the worse, some significantly and dramatically, others less so. Steve Jobs
                        changed the world signifuicantly, dramatically and in many ways for the better. Because of their
                        focus on “Computers for the rest of us” he and Steve Wozniak could have called the company they
                        built “Prometheus Computers.” The Apple II, Lisa, Mac, Newton, iPod, iTunes store, iPod Touch,
                        iPhone, iPad, are, in a sense, like the fire ‘stolen’ in the myth by Prometheus and given to
                        man. Jobs, however, while known for being tough, was not known for being pompous. He will be
                        missed by his family and friends. His ideas will be missed by the rest of us. Goodbye Steve, and
                        thanks.</p>
