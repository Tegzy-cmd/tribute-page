                <h1>Remembering Steve</h1>
                <p>Over a million people from all over the world have shared their memories, thoughts, and feelings
                    about Steve. One thing they all have in common — from personal friends to colleagues to owners of
                    Apple products — is how they’ve been touched by his passion and creativity. You can view some of
                    these messages below.<br>
                    And share your own at <a href="#">rememberingsteve@apple.com</a>

                    <p class="tribute-text">I was a total PC fan, and never understood Apple fans. Reading a bit about
                        what Steve was doing to Apple two years ago, I thought to myself "There must be something I am
                        missing, and as a teacher I need to understand why some people are so fond of these machines".
                        And it started with an offer for an iMac. The seller told me "Once you start with this, there is
                        no return. You will not want to go back to a PC". How right he was! I am now mainly using Apple,
                        only turning to a PC notebook due to me teaching in that environment. Sad to have missed so many
                        years of what Steve had been producing together with all you Apple people. He will certainly be
                        missed, but definitly not forgotten. His legacy is with you people. Make him proud. WIth my
                        deepest sympathy to all the Jobs family and the Apple family</p>
